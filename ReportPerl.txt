Perl Project

For this project, I started by using a regex search to grab only the necessary
lines, and placed the values of @ARGV into a string to place into a regex
search, to allow for a filter. There, I use a counter to check for the first
three lines (the headers) of the file. Once I had a line I needed, I would use
                my @line_element = split(/\s{2,}/, $line);
                my $bestLine = join ",", @line_element;
these two commands in ode to split them from spaces, and connect them with
commas to meet the CSV requirement.


I did not manage to sort the lines in time for the due date.
